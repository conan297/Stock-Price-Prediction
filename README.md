## Stock Price Prediction

This Jupyter notebook contains code for predicting future stock prices using machine learning algorithms. The notebook is divided into several sections, each of which performs a specific task in the prediction pipeline.

## Data Preprocessing

In this section, we load the historical stock price data from a CSV file and preprocess it to prepare it for machine learning. We perform the following steps:

Load the data from a CSV file using the pandas library.
Drop any missing values from the data using the dropna() function.
Convert the 'Date' column to a datetime object using the to_datetime() function.
Set the 'Date' column as the index of the DataFrame using the set_index() function.
Resample the data to a lower frequency (e.g., daily or weekly) using the resample() function.
Shift the 'Close' column by a certain number of periods to create a new 'label' column using the shift() function.
Fill any missing values in the 'label' column using the fillna() function.

## Feature Engineering

In this section, we create new features from the existing data to improve the accuracy of the machine learning model. We perform the following steps:

Calculate the percentage change in the 'Close' column using the pct_change() function.
Calculate the high-low percentage change in the 'Close' column using the pct_change() function.
Create a new column 'HL_pct' that contains the difference between the 'High' and 'Low' columns.
Create a new column 'PCT_change' that contains the percentage change in the 'Close' column.
Create a new column 'Forecast' that contains the shifted 'Close' column.

## Model Training

In this section, we train a machine learning model on the preprocessed data to predict future stock prices. We perform the following steps:

Split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split() function.
Train a machine learning model (e.g., linear regression, random forest, or LSTM) on the training set using the fit() function.
Evaluate the model on the testing set using the predict() function.
Calculate the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of the predictions using the mean_squared_error() and mean_absolute_error() functions.

## Model Evaluation

In this section, we evaluate the performance of the machine learning model on the testing set. We perform the following steps:

Plot the actual and predicted stock prices using the plot() function.
Calculate the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of the predictions using the mean_squared_error() and mean_absolute_error() functions.
Print the MSE and MAE values.

## Conclusion

In this notebook, we have demonstrated how to predict future stock prices using machine learning algorithms. We have preprocessed the data, created new features, trained a machine learning model, and evaluated its performance on the testing set. The results show that the machine learning model is able to predict future stock prices with reasonable accuracy.

To improve the accuracy of the model, we can try different machine learning algorithms, tune the hyperparameters of the model, or create new features from the data. We can also use more sophisticated techniques, such as ensemble learning or deep learning, to further improve the accuracy of the model.
